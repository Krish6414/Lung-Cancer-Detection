# Lung Disease Detection Using Image Classification

This project presents a deep learning approach for the classification of lung conditions (COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases) using chest X-ray images. It aims to assist medical professionals with a fast and accurate screening tool leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## üß† Project Overview

The main objective is to classify chest X-rays into three categories:

* **COVID-19**
* **Pneumonia**
* **Normal**

The model utilizes a custom-designed CNN architecture trained on a publicly available dataset of chest radiographs, aiming to improve diagnostic efficiency in clinical settings.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset comprises 6432 chest X-ray images divided into:

* 1200 COVID-19 cases
* 2432 pneumonia cases
* 2800 normal cases

The data is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset)** and has been preprocessed using techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **OpenCV**
* **NumPy, Pandas**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
* **Scikit-learn** (for evaluation metrics)

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The custom CNN model includes:

* Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation
* MaxPooling for down-sampling
* Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
* Fully connected dense layers
* Softmax activation for multiclass output

The model was trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## üìà Performance

The model achieved:

* **Training Accuracy:** \~96%
* **Validation Accuracy:** \~93%
* **Test Accuracy:** \~91%

Performance metrics used include precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## üìä Results

* The model showed strong performance in identifying normal and pneumonia cases.
* Some misclassification occurred between COVID-19 and pneumonia due to similar visual features.
* The confusion matrix and ROC curves support the reliability of predictions.

## üìé Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of using CNNs for lung disease classification, with the potential to support radiologists in clinical decision-making. Future improvements include:

* Model optimization
* Larger and more diverse datasets
* Real-time application integration
